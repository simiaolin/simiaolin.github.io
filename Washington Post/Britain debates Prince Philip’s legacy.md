# Britain debates Prince Philip’s legacy: Servant of queen and country? Or symbol of White male privilege?

## critics

**To his critics**, he was a relic, a throwback, who propped up a faintly ridiculous, soap-operatic House of Windsor — an over­indulged man who represented the extremes of White male privilege and fronted for a family that **traces its lineage to** Queen Victoria, **back to the days of** Britain’s empire, and its attendant colonialism and exploitation. The detractors **see a snob, a bigot and worse**.

John Crace, a sketch writer in the Guardian, sought to **take the prince and his admirers down a peg**, arguing that Johnson **went overboard in his praise of** Philip as “the polymath’s polymath,” as “a scientist, engineer, artist and conservationist rolled into one.”

Crace observed that “the evidence for this was **rather thin on the ground**.

## supporters

But his many fans **see a different duke**, who spent his life earning his unearned titles, who **steadfastly served** his wife and queen — and 800 different charities and organizations.

**Alongside** the praise — and condemnation — the lawmakers in Parliament agreed that the prince’s **most enduring legacy**, for real people, was the **Duke of Edinburgh Award**, a youth program that Philip once described as a “do-it-yourself growing up kit.”

Bush wrote that for all the tributes, the biggest achievement of Philip’s life is hardly noted: that “he leaves the British monarchy looking considerably more secure than he found it, and that **in an ever-changing world the Crown has managed to modernise and survive**.”

## change

But his speeches have been mostly forgotten, or ignored, this past week. Instead, he is best remembered for his **off-the-cuff remarks**.

“Oh, you know how **fickle** the British people can be. Having spent years criticizing him for being rude, even racist, now they love him,”


## status in recent years

In recent years Philip was seen as “**very middle of the field**” among the royal family, Seward said, **far less popular than** his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, **but ranked in polls above** the young lightning bolts, Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

It’s fair to say that, until his death, the duke was **respected, maybe admired, but not beloved**.
