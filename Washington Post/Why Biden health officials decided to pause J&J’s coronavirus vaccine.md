# Why Biden health officials decided to pause J&J’s coronavirus vaccine

“We don’t in the United States have a lot of tolerance for **friendly fire**, okay?” Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a webinar Tuesday with the American Medical Association. “We know we are fighting a war against covid-19, and we know that covid-19 is a devastating foe. But we also know when our medical countermeasures injure people, we don’t have a lot of tolerance for that, and that tends to undermine vaccine confidence.”

Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, questioned whether an “outright pause” was the right way to go. “It’s hard to **unscramble the egg**,” he said.

He said the key issue was to alert the medical community to be aware of clots associated with the vaccine — and of the need to treat them appropriately. He believes that **could probably have been accomplished without a full pause**, which might have a harmful longer term impact. He recalled a scare around the HPV vaccine in Japan that proved to be unwarranted but meant the program was never able to be reinstated.

Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, also expressed concerns about the action. “Let’s hope it doesn’t induce [vaccine] hesitancy,” he said. “We’re **in a critical race** with variants, and people are dying.”

The discussion was amiable — highly scientific without disagreements. Eventually they all agreed that “there is a tremendous need for vaccines but also a tremendous need for trust in the vaccine,” according to another official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the discussions.

In some countries, after reports of blood clots began to come in, the authorities paused use of the vaccine. In some places, they have restarted use of the vaccine but restricted it to older people. For example, authorities in Britain, which never paused use of the vaccine, last week determined that the risks of covid-19 were greater than the risks posed by the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine to all age groups except for adults under age 30 and said those younger adults should be offered other vaccines.

Leslie Francis, a medical ethicist at the University of Utah, said that the particular risks from severe covid-19 for different population groups must also **be factored into decisions** like this one. The J&J vaccine **slightly elevates** risk in younger women, who are at lower risk for disease than other parts of the population, Francis said.

“You do have to think about **distribution of risk**,” said Francis, who believes overall that the pause makes sense to build trust in the vaccination process.
